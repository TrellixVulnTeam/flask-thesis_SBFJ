Over 
the  past  few  years,  many  robots  with  human-like 
embodiment  have  been  developed.  Currently,  robots  that  “live” 
with  humans  are  only  used  as  pets.  However,  we  must  consider 
that humanoid robots will enter our daily lives in the near future. 
When  humanoid  robots  have  abilities  such  as  human-like 
behaviors  and  utterances,  how  will  we  be  influenced  by  these 
robots?  In  particular,  what  effects  will  they  have  on  emotional 
aspects of human relations and societies? 
We  consider  that  robots  can  collapse  human  relations  using  the 
balance theory [1]. Concretely, by controlling a robot’s behavior 
and utterances, we can control  a  human’s  impression  of  another 
human in group communication involving robots.  

In  this  paper,  we  performed  an  experiment  to  verify  how  social 
robots  influence  human  relations.  To  determine  this  effect,  we 
tried  to  confirm  what  occurs  in  the  human-robot  relationship. 
When robots take on sociality, these robots might easily construct 
or collapse human relations. We will examine these possibilities. 


An experiment was conducted to verify the effects of the robot’s 
sociality using the balance theory. 

A robot talked to two participants simultaneously. In this situation, 
we tried to determine how the robot’s behavior  would  influence 
the  impressions  of  (A)  one  participant  to  the  robot,  (B)  another 
participant  to  the  robot  and  (C)  one  participant  to  the  other 
participant. 

          Interactive Humanoid Robot “Robovie” 
We  used  the  interactive  humanoid  robot  “Robovie,”  which  is 
characterized  by  its  human-like  bodily  expressions  and  various 
sensors [3]. The body consists of eyes, a head, and arms, which 
generate 
for 
communication.

  Conditions 

This  experiment  has  three  conditions.  One  is  an  Agreement 
condition.  This  condition  states  that  the  robot  agrees  to  each 
participant’s  opinions.  Next  is  a  Disagreement  condition.  The 
robot in this condition disagrees with each participant’s opinions. 
In  these  two  conditions,  the  robot  agrees  or  disagrees  with 
participant’s opinion without distinction. On  the  other  hand,  the 
robot in an Unfairness condition agrees to only one participant’s 
opinion. In this condition, the robot behaves unequally. 

          Participants 
Forty-six university students participated in the experiment.  They 
do not have contact with robots on a daily basis. 

          Procedure 
Before  starting 
the  experiment,  each  participant  answered 
questions about their likes and dislikes. These answers were used 
to control  the  behavior  of  the  robot  during  the  experiment.  The 
robot acted to use the results of questions appropriately.  
Two participants interacted with the robot at the same time. This 
interaction  is  exchanging  questions  and  answers.  After  the 
experiment,  each  participant  answered  questionnaires.  The 
experimenter  asked  them  some  questions,  which  participants 
answered  concurrently  to  confirm  their  impressions  of  the  robot 
and each other. Finally, participants answered questions about (a) 
their  impressions  of  the  robot,  (b)  the  other  participant’s 
impressions  of  the  robot,  and  (c)  their  impressions  of  the  other 
participant.  From  analysis  of  the  responses,  we  tried  to  confirm 
whether

          Evaluation 
We  evaluated  this  experiment  with  questionnaires  containing  6 
items. These items are rated on a 1-to-5 scale, where 5 is the most 
positive. 

The  results  of  the  experiment  were  determined  by  analyzing  the 
questionnaire  responses.  Figure  1  illustrates  the  result  of  the 
participants’  impressions  of  the  other  participants  in  unfairness 
condition. We distributed three conditions to the plus and minus 
group  based  on  the  forecast  of  the  balance  theory.  We  consider 
that participants who were agreed with the robot on the opinion 
will have good impression to the robot. In the reverse case, they 
will have bad impression to the robot. In analogy with above two 
cases,  the  participants  in  clash  of  opinion  will  not  have  good 
impression  to  each  other.  From  this  forecast,  the  plus  group 
consists of participants in the Agree and Disagree conditions.  The 
robot  in  this  condition  agrees  or  disagrees  with  the  participants

without distinction. And the minus group consists of participants 
in  the  Unfairness  condition.  The  robot  in  this  condition  agrees 
with one participant. The ANOVA shows that there are significant 
differences in every question. This means that participants in the 
unfairness  condition  do  not  show  goodwill  toward  each  other. 
From these results, we confirmed the balance theory being applied 
in robot-mediated communication. 

Our  results  show  the  possibility  of  the  balance  theory  in 
group  communication  being  applied  by  two  humans  and  a 
humanoid  robot.  Previous  research  [2]  confirmed  that  the 
balance  theory  applied  by  disallowing  participants  to  talk  each 
other.  However,  when  participants  were  allowed  to  talk  to  each 
other, they did not confirm that the balance theory did not apply. 
In  our  experiment,  we allowed participants to talk each other in 
the  conversation  with  robot.  In 
the  balance 
theory  was  applied.  We  consider  that  the  existence  and  the 
embodiment are important for the social conversation with robot.  

this  situation, 


In this paper, we conducted an experiment to verify whether the 
balance  theory  applied  to  robot-mediated  communication.  Our 
results show the balance theory  being  applied  in  robot-mediated 
communication. From these results, we confirmed that robots may 
have good or bad influence on human relations. In other words, 
robots can construct or collapse human relations.
