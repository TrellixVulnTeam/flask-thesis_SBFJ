 
Over 
the  past  few  years,  many  robots  with  human-like 
embodiment  have  been  developed.  Currently,  robots  that  “live” 
with  humans  are  only  used  as  pets.  However,  we  must  consider 
that humanoid  robots  will enter  our  daily lives in  the  near  future. 
When  humanoid  robots  have  abilities  such  as  human-like 
behaviors  and  utterances,  how  will  we  be  influenced  by  these 
robots?  In  particular,  what  effects  will  they  have  on  emotional 
aspects of human relations and societies? 

We  consider  that  robots  can  collapse  human  relations  using  the 
balance  theory  [1].  Concretely,  by  controlling  a  robot’s  behavior 
and  utterances,  we  can  control  a  human’s  impression  of  another 
human in group communication involving robots. 

 

 

 

 

In  this  paper,  we  performed  an  experiment  to  verify  how  social 
robots  influence  human  relations.  To  determine  this  effect,  we 
tried  to  confirm  what  occurs  in  the  human-robot  relationship. 
When robots take on sociality, these robots might easily construct 
or collapse human relations. We will examine these possibilities. 

 
In  this  paper,  we  conducted  an  experiment  to  verify  whether  the 
balance  theory  applied  to  robot-mediated  communication.  Our 
results  show  the  balance  theory  being  applied  in  robot-mediated 
communication. From these results, we confirmed that robots may 
have  good  or  bad  influence  on  human  relations.  In  other  words, 
robots can construct or collapse human relations.
