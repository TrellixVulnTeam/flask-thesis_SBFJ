  If you want to know how to ‘break into’ video game pro- gramming, you can take your pick of popular press books on the topic.  These books advise aspiring game programmers to “explore schools with strong computer science departments” and check out game programming books and web tutorials [3].  For educators in computer science departments looking to advise their students, the question is more diﬃcult—there is very little research into what qualiﬁcations the video game industry considers important.  Though the fundamentals of computer science is a good starting point, we can better inform curricula for these video game programs if we know what game companies are really looking for.   This paper describes the results of a series of interviews and a survey at one game company.  The game company (which asked not to be identiﬁed) employs over 100 people and produces primarily 1st-person shooter games for main- stream consoles.  The goal of the research was to understand what qualiﬁcations game developers look for when evaluat- ing college hires.
