  Over  the  past  few  years,  many  robots  with  human-like  embodiment  have  been  developed.  However,  we  must  consider  that humanoid  robots  will enter  our  daily lives in  the  near  future.  Concretely,  by  controlling  a  robot’s  behavior  and  utterances,  we  can  control  a  human’s  impression  of  another  human in group communication involving robots.  To  determine  this  effect,  we  tried  to  confirm  what  occurs  in  the  human-robot  relationship.  When robots take on sociality, these robots might easily construct  or collapse human relations. From these results, we confirmed that robots may  have  good  or  bad  influence  on  human  relations.  In  other  words,  robots can construct or collapse human relations.
