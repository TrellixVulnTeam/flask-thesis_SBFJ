  Currently,  robots  that  “live”  with  humans  are  only  used  as  pets.   When  humanoid  robots  have  abilities  such  as  human-like  behaviors  and  utterances,  how  will  we  be  influenced  by  these  robots?  In  particular,  what  effects  will  they  have  on  emotional  aspects of human relations and societies?  We  consider  that  robots  can  collapse  human  relations  using  the  balance theory [1].  Concretely, by controlling a robot’s behavior  and utterances, we can control  a  human’s  impression  of  another  human in group communication involving robots.   When robots take on sociality, these robots might easily construct  or collapse human relations.     In this paper, we conducted an experiment to verify whether the  balance  theory  applied  to  robot-mediated  communication.  From these results, we confirmed that robots may  have good or bad influence on human relations.  In other words,  robots can construct or collapse human relations.
