   Implantable  medical  devices  (IMDs)  monitor  and  treat  physiological conditions within the body of a patient.   Hence,  there  is  a  strong need  to  design  a  secure remote  user  authentication scheme for IMDs by which the controller node  of  a  patient’s  IMDs  and  a  user  (for  example,  a  doctor)  can  mutually  authenticate  each  other.   To  address  such  an  important  issue  for  IMDs  communication  environment,  we  propose  a  new  secure  remote  user  authentication  and  key  agreement  scheme.    •  The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is  secure.    Network  model  of  IMDs  communication  environment   2)  Threat Model:  The well-known Dolev-Yao threat model  (DY model)  is used in the proposed scheme.   The  various  phases  of  the  proposed  scheme  are  discussed  in  Section  III.       The  use  of  IMDs  facilitates  the  remote  monitoring  of  the  health of a patient.   In  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  remote  user  authentication  scheme  through  which  a  user  (a  doctor)  and  a  controller  node  can  mutually  authenticate  each  other  and  establish a session key for their future secure communication.   The  computation and communication costs of the proposed scheme  are comparable with the existing related schemes.
