  Over  the  past  few  years,  many  robots  with  human-like  embodiment  have  been  developed.   Currently,  robots  that  “live”  with  humans  are  only  used  as  pets.   Concretely,  by  controlling  a  robot’s  behavior  and  utterances,  we  can  control  a  human’s  impression  of  another  human in group communication involving robots.                In  this  paper,  we  performed  an  experiment  to  verify  how  social  robots  influence  human  relations.   When robots take on sociality, these robots might easily construct  or collapse human relations.   Our  results  show  the  balance  theory  being  applied  in  robot-mediated  communication.   In  other  words,  robots can construct or collapse human relations.
