Generic text summarization is the task of generating a short and concise document, or a summary, that describes the content of a document or multiple documents. A summary will be considered good, if the summary represents the whole content of the document cluster. We thus Figure 1: Sentences in a document cluster. We manage this problem by incorporating the beneÔ¨Åt of each sentence being included in a summary. We proposed a novel text summarization model based on the budgeted median problem. The proposed model covers the entire document cluster through sentence assignment, since in our model every sentence is represented by one of the selected sentences as much as possible. An advantage of our method is that it can incorporate asymmetric relations between sentences in a natural manner.
