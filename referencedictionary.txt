10: '  Information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  facilitates  the  information  exchange  of  IMDs  and  provides  them  capabilities  to  com-  municate with each other', 11: '  IMDs  have  the  ability  to   send  the  collected  health  related  data  of  a  patient  to  the  nearby  controller  node  (CN )  using  the  communication  technologies  such  as   bluetooth,   zigbee   and   infrared   transmission', 12: '   CN  is  more  powerful  node  as  compared  to  IMDs    as    it    has  more  communication  range,  processing  power  and  storage  capability', 13: '  CN  is  connected  to  the  Internet  using  an  access  point', 14: ' A user  (for  example,  a  doctor)  can  access  the  data  of  an  IMD  via  CN  after  successful  mutual  authentication', 15: '  However,  in  such  kind  of  communication  environment,  there  are  several  security  and  privacy  related  issues  such  as  replay  attack,  man-in-the  middle  attack,  impersonation  attacks  and  privileged-insider attack , , ,', 16: '  Motivation   An  attacker  can  exploit  the  vulnerabilities  in  the  IMDs,  which can cause negative medical effects on the health of the  patient', 17: '  Such  effects  are  commonly  known  as  adverse  events', 18: ' According to the report available in , the vulnerability  in an implanted insulin pump could be exploited by a hacker (a  remote malicious user) which can cause an overdose of insulin  to  the  diabetic  patients', 19: '  The  overdose  of  insulin  could  then  cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level) which in extreme  case  becomes  a  diabetic  shock  to  the  patient', 20: '  Therefore,  security of IMDs becomes a serious concern so that an illegal  party  can not  attack  the  IMDs  implanted in  a patient’s  body', 21: '  Hence,  there  is  a  strong need  to  design  a  secure remote  user  authentication scheme for IMDs by which the controller node  of  a  patient’s  IMDs  and  a  user  (for  example,  a  doctor)  can  mutually  authenticate  each  other', 22: '  At  the  end,  both  entities  establish  a  secret  session  key  shared  between  them  for  their  future  secure  communications', 23: '  To  address  such  an  important  issue  for  IMDs  communication  environment,  we  propose  a  new  secure  remote  user  authentication  and  key  agreement  scheme', 24: '  Main Contributions   The contribution of this paper is manyfold:   •  We  propose  a  new  lightweight  three-factor  remote  user  authentication  scheme  for  implantable  medical  devices  in  which  the  controller node  of  the  implantable  medical  devices of a patient and remote user can authenticate each  other', 25: '   •  The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is  secure', 26: '  In  addition,  we  test  the  formal  security  verifica-  tion  of  the  proposed  scheme  using  the  widely-accepted  AVISPA tool to show the proposed scheme is also secure  against the replay and man-in-the middle attacks', 27: '   •  We  provide  the  practical  implementation  of  the  pro-  posed  scheme  using  the  widely-used  NS2    simulation  tool  to  measure  the  impact  of  the  scheme  on  network  performance  parameters  such  as  end-to-end  delay  and  throughput', 28: '  System Models   The  following  two  models  are  considered  to  describe  and   analyze the proposed scheme in the paper', 29: '   1)  Network  Model:  The  network  model  for  the  (IMD)s  communication environment shown in Figure 1 is used in the  proposed scheme', 30: ' In the given model, we have different types  of IMDs, such as brain neurosimulator and gastric simulator,  which are implanted in a patient’s body', 31: ' There is a controller  node (CN ) which collects data from all IMDs using wireless  communication  technologies  (for  example,  bluetooth,  zigbee  and  infrared  transmission)', 32: '  CN  is  connected  to  the  Internet  through an access point', 33: ' Suppose there is a user (for example, a doctor) Ui  wants  to  access  the  data  from  the  controller  node  belonging  to  a  set  of  implantable  medical  devices', 34: '  In this  scenario,  we  need  authentication  between  Ui  and  CN', 35: '   Network  model  of  IMDs  communication  environment   2)  Threat Model:  The well-known Dolev-Yao threat model  (DY model)  is used in the proposed scheme', 36: ' Under the DY  model, the communication takes place over insecure channels', 37: '  Any two communicating parties can communicate each other  using  a  public  channel  ,  in  which  the  end-point  entities,  such as IMDl, CN , and Ui, are not considered as trusted', 38: ' An   attacker A can then have the opportunity to eavesdrop, modify  or  delete  the  exchanged  messages  during  the  transmission  in  order to tamper the communicated data', 39: ' A can also physically  capture  CN  and  can  extract  the  stored  information  by  using  the power analysis attacks ,  as these devices are non-  tamper resistant', 40: ' However, all IMDs are implanted inside the  body  of  a  patient,  and  hence,  there  is  a  rare  possibility  of  physical capturing of IMDs from a patient’s body', 41: ' We further  assume  that  the  trusted  authority  (T A)  is  fully  trusted  party  in  the  network,  which  is  responsible  for  pre-deployment  of  IMDs and the user registration phase as described in Section  III', 42: '  Structure of the Paper   The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows', 43: '  In  Section  II,  we  discuss  the  existing  related  authentication  schemes  proposed  for  IMDs', 44: '  The  various  phases  of  the  proposed  scheme  are  discussed  in  Section  III', 45: '  The  security  analysis  of  the  proposed  scheme  is  provided  in  Section  IV', 46: '  The  formal  security verification of the proposed scheme using the widely-  accepted AVISPA tool is given in Section V', 47: ' The performance  comparison  of  the related  existing  schemes  and the  proposed  scheme is provided in Section VI', 48: ' The practical demonstration  of  the  proposed  scheme  using  the  widely-accepted  NS2  sim-  ulation tool is also provided in Section VII', 49: '      The  use  of  IMDs  facilitates  the  remote  monitoring  of  the  health of a patient', 50: ' The IMDs specially improve the quality of  life of elderly people, who  other has problem to move easily', 51: '  A  doctor  can  provide  them  remote  consultation  on  the  basis  of  their health  data,  which  is collected  by the  help  of IMDs', 52: '  However, wireless communication raises serious threats in the  IMD  deployment', 53: '  In  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  remote  user  authentication  scheme  through  which  a  user  (a  doctor)  and  a  controller  node  can  mutually  authenticate  each  other  and  establish a session key for their future secure communication', 54: '  Apart  from  that  the  pairwise  key  establishment  between  a  controller node and its IMDs is also provided in the proposed  scheme  for  the  secure  communication  between  them', 55: '  The  computation and communication costs of the proposed scheme  are comparable with the existing related schemes', 56: ' In addition,  the  proposed  scheme  also  provides  better  security  and  more  functionality features, such as password and biometric update  phase, dynamic controller node and IMD addition phases, as  compared to other existing related schemes'}
