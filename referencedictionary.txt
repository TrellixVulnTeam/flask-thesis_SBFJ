In  particular,  what  effects  will  they  have  on  emotional  aspects of human relations and societies?  We  consider  that  robots  can  collapse  human  relations  using  the  balance theory [1]', 5: ' Concretely, by controlling a robot’s behavior  and utterances, we can control  a  human’s  impression

control  the  behavior  of  the  robot  during  the  experiment', 27: '  The  robot acted to use the results of questions appropriately', 28: '   Two participants interacted with the robot at the same

questions,  which  participants  answered  concurrently  to  confirm  their  impressions  of  the  robot  and each other', 32: ' Finally, participants answered questions about (a)  their  impressions

ANOVA shows that there are significant  differences in every question', 53: ' This means that participants in the  unfairness  condition  do  not  show  goodwill  toward  each  other', 54: '  From these results, we confirmed the balance theory being applied  in robot-mediated communication', 55: '   Our  results  show  the  possibility  of  the  balance  theory  in  group  communication  being

However,  when  participants  were  allowed  to  talk  to  each  other, they did not confirm that the balance theory did not apply', 58: '  In  our  experiment,  we allowed participants to talk each
